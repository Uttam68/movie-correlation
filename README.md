# movie-correlation

In this project I have used different python libraries like pandas,numpy,matplotlib and seaborn to find which factors correlate the most with the gross of a movie.
Got the dataset from kaggle. It contains movies from 1980 to 2016. 


Please go through the python code.

In conclusion it is found that the budget and the votes correlate the most with the groos earning of the movies
